This document explains the content of "Table_Q5.txt" file generated as the result of executing "run_analysis.R" script. In short, "Table_Q5.txt" contains a summary of the data from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set that has been processed and filtered. For more information on the mentioned source data set refere to the readme file of this repository. 

"Table_Q5.txt" contains 88 variables (i.e., columns). Each row provides a set of information including the statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of the various data recorded 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial seonsor. The data in "Table_Q5.txt" are grouped by subject and activity type. The followings explain the data in each column of "Table_Q5.txt" as it appeard in the header of the file:

1) "Subject": Subject id is a number from 1 to 30 assigned to each individual participated in this experiment

2) "ActivityName": Type of activity; WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

3-88) These columns contain the meand or standard deviation of the measured data from the given subject and activity name as specified in columns 1 and 2 in each row, respectively. In the following, the name and unit of each variable is explained:

3) "TimeBodyAccelerationMeanX": Mean body accelerration in x direction (measured in g)
4) "TimeBodyAccelerationMeanY": Mean body accelerration in y direction (measured in g)
5) "TimeBodyAccelerationMeanZ": Mean body accelerration in z direction (measured in g)
6) "TimeBodyAccelerationStandardDeviationX": Standard deviation of body accelerration in x direction (measured in g)
7) "TimeBodyAccelerationStandardDeviationY": Standard deviation of body accelerration in y direction (measured in g)
8) "TimeBodyAccelerationStandardDeviationZ": Standard deviation of body accelerration in z direction (measured in g)
9) "TimeGravityAccelerationMeanX":  Mean gravity accelerration in x direction (measured in g)
